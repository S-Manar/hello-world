Greetings,

With a background in chemical engineering I am interested in software development, full stack engineering, data science and machine learning. I eventually want to specialise in one of these paths.

I have limited exposure to programming having done some introduction to C++ at university, but have started the CS50X and Python for Everybody online courses to get started on my journey.
