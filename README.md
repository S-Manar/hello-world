I come from a background in petroleum engineering, however I am interested in software development. I am specifically interested in front end engineering, data science and machine learning and I eventually want to specialise in one of these paths.

I have limited exposure to programming having done some introduction to C++ at university. I am currently taking CS50X and Python for Everybody online courses to get started on my journey.
