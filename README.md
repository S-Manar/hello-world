I come from a background in petroleum engineering, however I am interested in software development. I am specifically interested in front end engineering, data science and machine learning and I eventually want to specialise in one of these paths.

I have limited exposure to programming having done some introductory C++ at university. I am currently taking CS50X and decided on the Python for Everybody online course to get started on my journey since I have read that Python is very versatile and user friendly.
